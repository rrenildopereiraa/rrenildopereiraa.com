If you're thinking about moving away from Tailwind to Yumma CSS with larger or even medium-sized codebases, you might feel a bit discouraged at first.

What if I told you that you might be doing it all wrong?

## Introducing Transposer

Replacing all the Tailwind utilities manually is a real time-waster. Transposer makes it a breeze to convert your Tailwind code to Yumma CSS. Just paste the code and you're good to go!

## How does it work?

Basically, Transposer uses Typescript mappings to know exactly which equivalent classes to look for before replacing them with any Yumma CSS utility class.

```ts title="layoutClasses.ts"
export const layoutClasses = new Map<string, string>([
  // Display
  ["block", "d-b"],
  ["flex", "d-f"],
  ["flow-root", "d-fr"],
  ["grid", "d-g"],
  ["hidden", "d-none"],
  // ...
]);
```
