If you're familiar with Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS, you know how tough it can be to debug your codebase, especially when you're working on a big application. Honestly, every Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS project I worked on ended up with far too many lines of code, and it got to a point where I got bored with that approach.

## How does Yumma CSS Compare?

[Yumma CSS](https://www.yummacss.com/) uses an abbreviated naming convention that’s similar to the regular CSS syntax.

### Centering using Flexbox

Let's see how centering with Flex box fares in these frameworks:

**Using Bootstrap**

```html
<div class="align-items-center d-flex justify-content-center">...</div>
```

**Using Tailwind CSS**

```html
<div class="items-center flex justify-center">...</div>
```

**Using Yumma CSS**

```html
<div class="ai-c d-f jc-c">...</div>
```

## Media queries and variants

Yumma CSS offers a set of pseudo-classes and responsive breakpoints such as _sm:*_, _md:*_, _lg:*_, _xl:*_, and _xxl:*_. This makes it easy to adapt your designs based on screen size and user interactions.

## Building components

Let’s see how Yumma CSS stacks up against Tailwind CSS when building a Card Grid component.

Tailwind CSS Card

```html
<div class="grid h-screen w-full gap-4 p-6 md:grid-flow-dense md:grid-cols-3 md:grid-rows-3">
    <div
        class="flex flex-col overflow-hidden rounded-xl border border-gray-200 bg-white p-6 shadow-lg md:col-span-1 md:row-span-2">
        <div class="flex-grow">
